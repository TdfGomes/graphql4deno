# Graphql for Deno

Is very tiny and simple graphql http server built on top of [Deno http module](https://deno.land/std/http) using some [GraphQL utilities](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/).

My goal with this was to have a simple dedicated http server to run GraphQL, no router, midllewares or..., something else. Just your schema and a http server.

>This is heavily on development so the design and some decisions can change, still in progress...
